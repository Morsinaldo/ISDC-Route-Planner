# Overview

The goal of this project is to build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map. All instructions are contained in the [notebook file](./project_notebook.ipynb).

## Project Files

- **project_notebook.ipynb**: The notebook file where the implementations will be made.
- **helpers.py**: Python file with the helpers functions.
- **test.py**: Python file with the tests.

## Project Rubric

- **Does the submission pass all tests?**: Running [test.py](./test.py) shows "all tests pass".
- **Does student implement A* search methods?**: The student implements all required methods.
- **Is the heuristic used in A* search admissible?**: The heuristic function used to estimate the distance between two intersections is guaranteed to return a distance which is less than or equal to the true path length between the intersections.
- **Did Student answer all of the questions correctly?**: Student answered all question correctly.
